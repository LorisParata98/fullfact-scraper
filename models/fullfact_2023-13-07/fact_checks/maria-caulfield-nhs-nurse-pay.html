<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="matching-nurse-pay-to-inflation-wouldnt-cost-each-household-1000"></a><h2>Matching nurse pay to inflation wouldn’t cost each household £1,000</h2>
<p>During an interview on BBC Breakfast <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1603298194674286592">Ms Caulfield said</a>, in response to a question about nurses’ pay: “If we matched, say to 11%, which is just above inflation right now, that would add about £1,000 to every household in the country.” </p>
<p>We <a href="/economy/28-billion-public-sector-pay-increase/">fact checked the same claim</a> earlier this week when health secretary Steve Barclay claimed: “If everyone in the public sector had a pay rise in line with inflation, it would cost an extra £28 billion, an extra £1,000 per household."</p>
<p>So this is a figure referring to pay rises across the public sector, not just the pay of nurses. </p>
<p>Last financial year (2021/22), the public sector pay bill was <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1091951/E02754802_PESA_2022_elay.pdf#page=88">just under £233 billion</a>. The <a href="/economy/28-billion-public-sector-pay-increase/">Treasury has told  us</a> that this year it estimates the pay bill will be about 5% higher (putting it at about £244 billion).</p>
<p>If this rises by 11% next year (in line with <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/october2022">CPI inflation</a> in October), it will reach around £271 billion, or £27 billion above what it is this year. The Treasury also said “pay drift and workforce growth” would have some impact, so came up with a final figure of approximately £28 billion. Divided equally between the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2021">28 million households</a> in the UK, this gives a rough figure of around £1,000 per household. </p>
<p>There are several issues with this calculation. </p>
<p>Firstly there’s the question of how relevant it is to the current situation. It reflects the change in the pay bill for public sector employees from 2022/23 to 2023/24, despite the fact that many of the ongoing pay disputes are about the amount by which pay has already increased in 2022/23 when compared to 2021/22. </p>
<p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), for example, <a href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/w-rcn-members-urged-to-support-industrial-action-in-ballot-over-nhs-pay-090822">is striking</a> over the pay increase nurses were given in 2022/23, while Communication Workers Union members are <a href="https://www.cwu.org/rmgstrikeinfo">also striking</a> partly due to a current pay deal offered by Royal Mail.</p>
<p>If the government wanted to increase the average pay award this year to 11%, it wouldn’t cost the government £28 billion extra because public sector workers have already been given an <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/news/even-if-real-pay-cut-5-public-sector-workforce-may-need-be-cut-more-200000-2024-stay-within#:~:text=8%20October%202022-,Public%20sector%20workers%20will%20receive%20pay%20awards%20of%20around%205%25%20this%20year%2C%20on%20average.,-Employment%20and%20income">average 5% pay award this year</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the estimated “extra” cost involved in increasing that 5% to match inflation (based on a slightly lower inflation rate of 10.5%) would be <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-10/Public-spending-pay-and-pensions-R219.pdf#page=14">around £13 billion</a>.</p>
<p>If the government wanted to increase wages by 11% next year, that would be well in excess of the expectations for <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/inflation-set-fall-early-2023">inflation next year</a>, which is predicted to fall.</p>
<p>Putting aside questions over how relevant the £28 billion figure is, there’s also a problem with how it's calculated.The Treasury <a href="/economy/28-billion-public-sector-pay-increase/#:~:text=5%25%20above%20inflation.-,What%20about%20tax%3F,-The%20above%20figures">previously confirmed </a>to us that its calculation did not take into account tax which would be returned directly to the Treasury as a result of increasing wages, meaning the net cost of an 11% pay increase may be lower than £28 billion. </p>
<p>It’s also important to note that Ms Caufield was specifically responding to a question about nurse pay when she claimed that matching pay to inflation would cost every UK household about £1,000. </p>
<p>In fact, as we have set out above, this calculation is based on all public sector workers in the UK (an estimated <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/september2022">5.8 million employees</a>). In the NHS in England in June 2021, there were <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/key-facts-figures-nhs">around 330,000</a> nursing staff including midwives and health visitors. </p>
<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="unclear-if-increasing-nurse-pay-by-19-would-cost-an-additional-10-billion"></a><h2>Unclear if increasing nurse pay by 19% would cost an additional £10 billion </h2>
<p>During multiple interviews about nurse pay Ms Caufield claimed that matching 19% pay (the same increase as that <a href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-nhs-pay-prb-evidence-rcn-demands-pay-rise-five-per-cent-above-inflation-070322">called for by the RCN</a>) increase would cost around £10 billion. </p>
<p>She told <a href="https://twitter.com/GBNEWS/status/1603289106380951552">GB News</a>: “The RCN is asking for a 19% pay rise—that’s £10 billion of funding that we would have to find.” </p>
<p>Also, in an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1603292566694367235">Sky News</a> she said: “For every 1% that we agree for the nurses or for anyone else in fact that’s around £700 million that we have to find.”</p>
<p>This appears to refer to <a href="https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2022/11/30/nhs-industrial-action-media-fact-sheet-2/">information published</a> by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) in December, which stated: “Uplifting pay for all staff on the Agenda for Change contract by 19.0%, instead of the existing 22/23 award, would cost around an additional £9.8 billion”. It also said that “each additional 1% of pay for all Agenda for Change staff would cost around £700 million per year”. </p>
<p>Agenda for Change is an <a href="https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/working-health/working-nhs/nhs-pay-and-benefits/agenda-change-pay-rates/agenda-change-pay-rates">NHS pay system</a> which covers all staff except doctors, dentists and very senior managers, and was <a href="https://navigator.health.org.uk/theme/agenda-change">introduced in 2004</a>. The <a href="https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2022/11/30/nhs-industrial-action-media-fact-sheet-2/#:~:text=workers%20%2D%20and%20it-,aligns%20pay%20scales,-and%20career%20progression">government says</a> the contract “aligns pay scales and career progression across all groups, meaning pay rises apply to everyone under this contract”. </p>
<p>In other words, the way the contract works means that if nurses get a pay rise, other NHS staff would too. So the £9.8 billion figure refers to all NHS staff on Agenda for Change contracts who would also be entitled to a pay rise—not just nurses. </p>
<p>The £9.8 billion figure appears to simply multiply the <a href="https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2022/11/30/nhs-industrial-action-media-fact-sheet-2/">£700 million</a> figure by 14, reflecting the fact that the 19% request would be 14 percentage points higher than the existing pay award, which averages around 5%, though the DHSC has not confirmed this. . </p>
<p>It’s not clear from the fact sheet published by the government how exactly the £700 million figure has been calculated, or if it takes into account the same issues with taxation that we described with the £28 billion figure above. </p>
<p>We asked DHSC how it was calculated, and if it took into account money that could be recouped through higher rates of taxation, but did not receive an explanation.</p>

<p>Ms Caufield also repeatedly claimed that for each percentage point pay was increased, the government would have to find either £700 million or £800 million. </p>
<p>She told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001g37g">Radio 4’s Today programme</a>: “For every percent we’d have to put pay up, that’s £700 million we’d have to find”. </p>
<p>About two minutes later she said: “For every 1% we put pay up we have to find £800 million.” </p>
<p>DHSC confirmed to us that Ms Caulfield misspoke when she said £800 million, and that the figure was in fact £700 million. </p>
