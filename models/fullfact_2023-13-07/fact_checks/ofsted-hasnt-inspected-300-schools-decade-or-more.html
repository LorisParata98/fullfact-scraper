<p>It’s correct that <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=8">1,620</a> schools had not been inspected by Ofsted for at least six years as of August 2017. That’s according to Ofsted data analysed by the National Audit Office (NAO). <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=27">97%</a> of those schools (1,570) were rated outstanding at their last inspection, while the remaining 3% (50 schools) were rated good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=8">296</a> of these schools had not been inspected for between 10 and 11 years. All of these were rated outstanding at their last inspection.</p>
<p>91% of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-school-places-scorecards-2017">92,500</a> new school places in England primary and secondary state schools between 2015/16 and 2016/17 were in those that had a good or outstanding rating from Ofsted.</p>

<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="why-havent-they-been-inspected"></a><h2>Why haven’t they been inspected?</h2>
<p>There are around <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=7">21,500</a> state-funded schools in England, teaching around eight million pupils, that Ofsted inspects. It can give four types of rating for the overall effectiveness of a school: outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate.</p>
<p>Ofsted has to inspect schools <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=26">every five years</a>, unless the school was last graded as outstanding. Outstanding schools are <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696842/Further_education_and_skills_inspection_handbook_April_2018.doc.pdf#page=6">exempt from routine re-inspection</a>, but may be <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/699810/School_inspection_handbook_section_5.pdf#page=9">inspected sooner</a> if concerns are raised or there’s a significant change.</p>
<p>Outstanding special schools, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268940/alternative_provision_statutory_guidance_pdf_version.pdf#page=5">pupil referral units</a> (which provide full-time education for permanently excluded children or those who have missed school because of illness) and state-funded nursery schools are not exempt, and will usually have short inspections <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07091">every four years</a>. The same goes for <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07091">schools rated good</a>. </p>
<p>Schools rated good are also subject to shorter one-day inspections <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07091">every four years</a>, and schools that require improvement usually have a full re-inspection within <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07091">two and a half years</a>.</p>
<p>Schools that convert to academies are <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/699810/School_inspection_handbook_section_5.pdf#page=74">considered to be</a> new schools. The new academy will usually be inspected by Ofsted within <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-ofsted-will-inspect-academy-schools-including-free-schools">three years of reopening</a>. That said, the <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=26">NAO found that</a> between 2012/13 and 2016/17 312 schools that had converted to academies went at least five years before being inspected.</p>
<p>The NAO also found that of the <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=27">215</a> schools last rated good had not been inspected for five or more years, most of these were converted academies. <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=27">186</a> of those had converted to academies after their last inspection and had not been inspected since.</p>
<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="what-does-that-mean-for-schools"></a><h2>What does that mean for schools?</h2>
<p>Ofsted’s director of corporate strategy <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-44227869">reportedly</a> agreed with the statement that some outstanding schools weren’t “really outstanding”. The NAO’s report <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=26">said</a>: “The older an inspection judgement, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate.”</p>
<p>They added: “exempting outstanding schools from routine re-inspection reduces the extent to which Ofsted’s inspectors see outstanding schools, and therefore the extent to which they can compare with and reference outstanding practice.”</p>
<p>As of August 2017, <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=20">20%</a> of schools, including primary, secondary, special schools and pupil referral units, had been rated outstanding for overall effectiveness by Ofsted at their last inspection. 65% had been rated good, 9% required improvement, 2% were inadequate and 4% hadn’t yet been inspected. This does not include education providers that are solely <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf#page=20">nurseries or sixth forms</a>.</p>

<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="91-of-new-school-places-were-created-in-good-or-outstanding-rated-schools"></a><h2>91% of new school places were created in good or outstanding-rated schools</h2>
<p>Between 2015/16 and 2016/17, around <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-school-places-scorecards-2017">92,500</a> new school places were created in England’s primary and secondary state schools. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-school-places-scorecards-2017">84,400</a> (91%) of these places were at schools rated outstanding or good at their last Ofsted inspection as of August 2017. </p>
<p>The data was collected by local authorities by measuring school capacities between May 2016 and May 2017. Not all school places were included, for example free schools (schools <a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools">funded by central government</a>, not run by the local authority) and sponsored academies that hadn’t yet had an Ofsted inspection. Increases of fewer than 15 places in a school weren’t counted as new places.</p>
