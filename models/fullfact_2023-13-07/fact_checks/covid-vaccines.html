<p>People who are undergoing or have recently had certain treatments, such as chemotherapy, or who are immunosuppressed for other reasons, are generally <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/%20immunisations-and-cancer-treatment">advised not</a> to have ‘live’ vaccinations, or to be in close contact with people who have recently been immunised with certain live vaccinations.</p>
<p><a href="http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/types-of-vaccine">Live vaccines</a> contain whole bacteria or viruses which have been “weakened” so that they trigger an immune response without causing disease in healthy people. </p>
<p>In clinically <a href="https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/live-attenuated-vaccines-avoid-use-in-those-who-are-clinically-immunosuppressed">immunosuppressed</a> people, however, there is a potential risk of infection if live vaccines are used. Similarly, immunosuppressed people are sometimes advised not to have close contact with other people who have recently had certain live vaccines because of a risk that they may be able to spread viral particles. We have <a href="/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/">written</a> about this process, which is sometimes colloquially known as ‘vaccine shedding’, before. </p>
<p>The Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines that have received authorisations in the UK so far are not live vaccines, and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/health-conditions/">therefore</a> <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/coronavirus/vaccine">can</a> be given to people who have recently received chemotherapy. In fact, people who are immunosuppressed have been included in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#cev">priority groups</a> for the Covid-19 vaccines.  </p>

<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="it-was-only-tested-for-a-very-short-time-on-completely-healthy-people-no-polypharma-users-in-the-tests"></a><h2>“It was only tested, for a very short time on completely healthy people. No polypharma users in the tests.”</h2>
<p>The studies for all three of the Covid-19 vaccines currently authorised for use in the UK included cohorts of people with underlying health conditions, as well as ‘completely healthy people’ in the trials. </p>
<p>Approximately 21% of the people included in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">Pfizer’s</a> phase three trial, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_appendix.pdf#page=9">published</a> in The New England Journal of Medicine, for example, had background comorbidity (meaning they had other medical conditions). <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_appendix.pdf#page=9">These</a> <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">included</a> a wide range of medical conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular problems and diabetes. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932661-1#page=6">A significant number</a> of people given the AstraZeneca vaccine in phase three trials had underlying cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or diabetes.

<p>Based on the research, and the increased risk that Covid-19 poses to people with certain underlying medical conditions, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that the Covid-19 vaccines are <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/safety-of-covid-19-vaccines">safe and effective</a> for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Remuje4bs">people</a> with conditions such as high blood pressure; diabetes and asthma amongst others. People with underlying health conditions have also been included as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-care-home-and-healthcare-settings-posters/covid-19-vaccination-first-phase-priority-groups">priority group</a> for vaccination by the UK government. </p>

<p>Of the three Covid-19 vaccines that have been authorised for use in the UK, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-uk-recipients-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer/BioNTech</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca">Oxford-AstraZeneca</a> vaccines have temporary authorisation (sometimes known as a regulation 174 authorisation) while the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna">Moderna</a> vaccine has conditional marketing authorisation.</p>
<p>All three of these vaccines  (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">Pfizer</a>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932661-1">AstraZeneca</a> and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389">Moderna</a>) have had analysis of safety and efficacy data from <a href="https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development">phase three trials</a> (involving tens of thousands of participants) published in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/media-center/publication-process">peer</a>-<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/publishing-excellence#peer">reviewed</a> articles in medical journals such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. The collection of long term protection and safety data will continue over the next couple of years, and so the completion dates for the trials are in <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427">2022</a> <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728">and</a> <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746">2023</a>.  </p>
<p>Normally, vaccines <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1916/made/data.pdf#page=35">go through</a> a process called <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/access-to-treatment/how-are-drugs-licensed-in-the-uk">marketing authorisation</a> (<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/access-to-treatment/how-are-drugs-licensed-in-the-uk">also known as a licence</a>). In certain scenarios, however, for <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1916/regulation/174/made">example in response</a> to “pathogenic agents”, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) may use different types of authorisation.</p>
<p>The MHRA told Full Fact that temporary authorisation and conditional marketing authorisations are “regulatory tools that enable medicines to be approved at the earliest time possible during an emergency situation, as soon as there are robust data to show that the benefits outweigh the risks [...]”</p>
<p>The MHRA also expanded on the differences between the two types of authorisation. It explained that a regulation 174 or temporary authorisation is not the same as a licence, instead “it authorises the emergency supply of an unlicensed medicine in response to an unmet public health need [and is] triggered by the Government, whereas conditional authorisation is applied for by the company.” </p>
<p>It also explained that a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA), which the Moderna vaccine has, “is an early, temporary licence for a medicine where there is an unmet health need [...] CMAs are reviewed on an annual basis and can be converted into a full marketing authorisation but authorisations under Regulation 174 cannot,” though that doesn’t mean Pfizer or AstraZeneca would be prevented from applying for a change to the authorisations for their Covid-19 vaccines in the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the MHRA said: “Our rigorous review of the safety, quality and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine candidates is the same for both routes and no vaccine would be authorised via a CMA or R174 unless the expected high standards are met.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-expert-working-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-safety-surveillance/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-expert-working-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-safety-surveillance">MHRA</a> has said that the trials for the Covid-19 vaccines have proceeded “without compromising any of the usual, high standards of scientific rigour [...] tens of thousands of subjects have been included in trials and all are subject to very close safety follow-up over several months.”</p>

            because people who are receiving chemotherapy can in general receive the Covid-19 vaccines that are authorised at the moment (and more generally, vaccines that aren’t live), and the vaccine trials did include trialists with medical conditions.
