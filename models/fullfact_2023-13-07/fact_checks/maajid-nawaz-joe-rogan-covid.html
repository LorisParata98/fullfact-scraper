                <p>The broadcaster Maajid Nawaz got many of the facts about Covid-19 wrong while talking on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a>.</p>
<p>The podcast was released on 19 February 2022, but it was recorded <a href="https://twitter.com/MaajidNawaz/status/1494339464960745472?s=20&amp;t=6CWb2MG2DrSi2lFcwYKecA">around three weeks earlier</a>, on or around 25 January. At one point [<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h, 56m, 40s</a>], Mr Nawaz describes an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/antivax-covid-szilveszter-csollany-hungary-b2000002.html">article from that day’s Independent</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220125090020/https:/www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/antivax-covid-szilveszter-csollany-hungary-b2000002.html">as “today’s news”</a>.</p>
<p>We have written about <a href="/health/joe-rogan-alex-berenson-covid-vaccines-phe/">Covid misinformation</a> <a href="/health/joe-rogan-over-70-percent/">on the Joe Rogan Experience</a> twice before.</p>
<p>Full Fact made contact with Mr Nawaz to ask about his misleading claims. His literary agency replied: “Unfortunately, Maajid’s hectic schedule means he will not be able to participate this time.”</p>

<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="the-covid-vaccines-do-protect-children-against-severe-covid"></a><h3><strong>The Covid vaccines do protect children against severe Covid</strong></h3>
<p>When discussing the Covid vaccines, Mr Rogan asked Mr Nawaz [at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h, 31m, 40s</a>]: “But doesn’t it still protect them from hospitalisation and death?”</p>
<p>Mr Nawaz replied: “Depending on age. So, a five-year-old? Definitely not. A 12-year-old? No.”</p>
<p>This is false.</p>
<p>We have written before that the <a href="/health/nhs-covid-risk-children/">risk to children of severe illness from Covid is very low</a>. However, vaccination does reduce even this small risk, both in healthy children and in children with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/children-facts.html#:~:text=can%20also%20protect%20your%20child%20from%20severe%20disease%2C%20hospitalizations%2C%20or%20developing%20long%2Dterm%20complications%20if%20they%20do%20get%20COVID%2D19">the vaccines can protect children of 5 and older</a> “from severe disease, hospitalizations, or developing long-term complications if they do get COVID-19”.</p>
<p>A CDC study published in January 2022 found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7102e1.htm">91% effective</a> in protecting against multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a serious but rare condition associated with Covid that can occur in children.</p>
<p>In the UK, talking about children aged 12-15, the NHS says: “1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine-for-children-aged-12-to-15/#:~:text=1%20dose%20of%20the%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine%20gives%20good%20protection%20against%20your%20child%20getting%20seriously%20ill.%20But%202%20doses%20gives%20stronger%20and%20longer%2Dlasting%20protection.">gives good protection against your child getting seriously ill</a>. But 2 doses gives stronger and longer-lasting protection.”</p>
<p>The Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has said that vaccination protects against severe illness in healthy <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-september-2021-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-12-to-15-years/jcvi-statement-on-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-12-to-15-years-3-september-2021">12-15-year-olds</a>, calculating that a million first doses of the vaccine would prevent about 87 hospitalisations in this age group. It has also recommended a “non-urgent offer” of the vaccine to all <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-update-on-advice-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11/jcvi-statement-on-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years-old">5-11-year-olds</a> in order to “increase the immunity of vaccinated individuals against severe COVID-19”.</p>
<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="infection-rates-were-higher-in-england-in-january-2022"></a><h3><strong>Infection rates were higher in England in January 2022</strong></h3>
<p>Mr Nawaz said [at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h, 26m, 05s</a>]: “Today, right now, England that doesn’t have vaccine passports, compared to Wales and Scotland that do. And we have lower [infection] rates in England.”</p>
<p>In fact, when he was speaking, England had higher Covid prevalence than either Wales or Scotland.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveyheadlineresultsuk/2022">the Coronavirus Infection Survey</a><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveyheadlineresultsuk/2022"> from the Office for National Statistics</a>, about 6.85% of the population of England would test positive for Covid in the data published on 19 January, compared with 5.56% in Wales and 5.65% in Scotland.</p>
<p>In the data published on 26 January, it was about 5.47% in England, 3.69% in Wales and 4.49% in Scotland. (And indeed England still has a higher prevalence, in the latest data available, which was published on 23 February.) </p>
<p>If Mr Nawaz was thinking of <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases">daily reported Covid cases</a> instead, he was also incorrect. England detected more Covid cases per 100,000 people than either Wales or Scotland throughout the week ending 25 January 2022.</p>
<p>Many factors could influence different infection rates in different places—including differences in weather, behaviour, vaccination rates and past infection rates. They are not necessarily caused by different vaccination rules.</p>
<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="far-more-than-17000-people-died-of-covid-in-the-uk"></a><h3><strong>Far more than 17,000 people died of Covid in the UK</strong></h3>
<p>Mr Nawaz seemed to repeat a common falsehood that only around 17,000 people in the UK have died of Covid. This is not true, and is something we have checked <a href="/health/dan-wootton-covid-only-deaths/">twice</a> <a href="/online/alex-belfield-youtube-17500/">before</a>.</p>
<p>During a series of exchanges with Mr Rogan, Mr Nawaz said that a large number of deaths had occurred in the UK recently</p>
<p>Mr Nawaz said [at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h, 32m, 05s</a>]: “The Office for National Statistics in the UK through a Freedom of Information request has just revealed the number of people who died solely from Covid with no other co-existing illness: 17,731, if my memory serves […] Total number of people from the beginning of this pandemic who have died only from Covid […] in Britain. We were told the figure was in the hundreds of thousands. Now this is all coming out in the UK now. There’s a bit of a retreat from all of this narrative.”</p>
<p>He also said [at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h 53m 25s</a>]: “[The ONS] said, yeah, 17,000—whatever it was, 730-whatever—people died only from Covid since the beginning of this pandemic, right.”</p>
<p>Later, he said [at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h 58m 45s</a>]: “We know the Covid deaths are 17,000.”</p>
<p>This appears to refer to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/deathsfromcovid19withnootherunderlyingcauses">a real FOI response from the ONS</a>, which said that 17,371 people in England and Wales had died of Covid by the end of September 2021 without any other pre-existing conditions mentioned on their death certificates. This means that a doctor familiar with the case recorded Covid as the underlying cause of death, but did not record any other pre-existing contributory causes. (The doctor may have included some other contributory causes which followed after the infection with Covid.)</p>
<p>This was not new information, despite what Mr Nawaz said. The data has been <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales">regularly published since early 2021</a>.</p>
<p>It also <em>does not mean</em> that these are the only people who truly died “of Covid”. In a <a href="https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2022/01/26/to-say-only-17000-people-have-died-from-covid-19-is-highly-misleading/#:~:text=to%20suggest%20that%20figure%20represents%20the%20real%20extent%20of%20deaths%20from%20the%20virus%20is%20both%20factually%20incorrect%20and%20highly%20misleading.">blog published on 26 January</a>, the ONS said “to suggest that [the 17,371] figure represents the real extent of deaths from the virus is both factually incorrect and highly misleading”.</p>
<p>Death certificates allow doctors to record multiple causes of death, but only one is counted as the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#:~:text=The%20underlying%20cause%20of%20death%20is%20defined%20by%20WHO%20as%20the%20disease%20or%20injury%20that%20initiated%20the%20train%20of%20events%20directly%20leading%20to%20death%20or%20the%20circumstances%20of%20the%20accident%20or%20violence%20that%20produced%20the%20fatal%20injury.">underlying cause</a>. This cause is what people are ultimately said to die “of”. However, it is common for doctors to mention other conditions that played a part in the death, either before or after the underlying cause occurred.</p>
<p>Indeed, many common underlying causes of death, including dementia, heart disease, cancer and pneumonia, are mentioned as part of a list of <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahCaul_ONS/status/1493972349833646087?s=20&amp;t=4wgIQofgxKfaSlDh3yGLSg">two or three different causes</a>, on average.</p>
<p>As an example, if someone dies with an underlying cause of cancer, but also had diabetes beforehand, that doesn’t mean they didn’t really die of cancer.</p>
<p>In fact, when Nr Nawaz was speaking, the data showed that <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales">142,576</a> <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales/2022">deaths due to Covid</a> had been registered in England and Wales alone.</p>
<a class="nav-offset-anchor" id="sajid-javid-did-not-say-that-all-covid-deaths-have-been-overestimated"></a><h3><strong>Sajid Javid did not say that all Covid deaths have been overestimated</strong></h3>
<p>Mr Nawaz said [at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM?si=dGnqMxlWSnmMWzyiBNw1WQ">1h 55m 32s</a>]: “So the Health Secretary in the UK came out and admitted that the Covid deaths had been overestimated because there’s been a mix between ‘with Covid’ and ‘of Covid’.”</p>
<p>This is missing some important context.</p>
<p>Mr Nawaz appears to be referring to comments made by the Health Secretary Sajid Javid on 19 January 2022, which Mr Nawaz <a href="https://twitter.com/MaajidNawaz/status/1485237502118174722?s=20&amp;t=DbAw209ydCrLoe4cueaZOA">tweeted about on 23 January</a> and has <a href="https://maajidnawaz.substack.com/p/liar-liar-fc1?fbclid=IwAR0W0yrFKWhE-PbGljuYofgnyPxg2d-do7tKsb7BwaNIwMa77tx08o217rg&amp;utm_source=url#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDaily%20reported%20Covid%20death%20figures%20are%20too%20high%20because%20people%20are%20dying%20from%20conditions%20unrelated%20to%20the%20virus%20after%20testing%20positive%E2%80%9D%20UK%20Health%20Secretary%20Sajid%20Javid%20admitted">also mentioned subsequently on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://youtu.be/tjb1bkfHE54?t=2006">press conference</a>, Mr Javid said: “Also, with Omicron […] we estimate around 40% of the people with Covid in hospital are there not because they’ve got Covid. They happen to have Covid […] The deaths that are being reported of people that were Covid positive within 28 days of passing away, that many of those people would not have necessarily died of Covid.”</p>
<p>This means that the daily death figures following a positive Covid test might have included a substantial number of ‘incidental’ Covid deaths. However, it does not mean that this was true to the same extent before the emergence of Omicron in the UK in December 2021.</p>
<p>It also does not mean that death figures based on death certificates are exaggerated at all, because they show the cause of death as assessed by a doctor familiar with the case, not simply the number of people who died after testing positive.</p>
<p>In short, these comments from Mr Javid do not mean that the overall Covid death toll has been exaggerated—only that the daily deaths measure published by the government had become less accurate.</p>
